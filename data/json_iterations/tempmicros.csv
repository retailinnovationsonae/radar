As costs of living increase, individuals are focusing on ensuring zero waste when cooking from home. Waitrose suggested that instead of following three meals a day or eating excessively, consumers tend to graze throughout the day and adjust their eating routine to suit their busy lives. Likewise, fewer people are choosing to do a weekly ‘big shop', and are instead opting to purchase fresh produce multiple times per week. This behaviour will continue to contribute to reducing waste, as less product is being thrown out. According to Whole Foods, food manufacturers are responding to this shift in consumer behaviour and values “by using parts of plants or animals that were once considered trash, such as pickled watermelon rinds or broccoli-stem slaw”.
