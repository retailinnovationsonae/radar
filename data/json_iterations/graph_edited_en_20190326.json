According to the same source, this successful event demonstrated that �renewable energy can be relied upon as a secure and viable source with which to completely meet the country�s electricity demands�. Some of the biggest companies in the world, including Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, are massively buying renewable energy and, consequently, reshaping the entire supply chain. �The IT sector has been responsible for more than 7GW of new renewable energy globally � enough to power 5m homes� says Gary Cook, Greenpeace�s senior corporate campaigner.

To the unaware, the myriad of intolerances we hear about seems to have sprung from nowhere, but it certainly drove an unforeseen demand for the likes of tempeh, kefir, kimchi, flaxseed, and anything else that helps the consumer to steer clear from the wide selection of ingredients they've found harmful (think gluten, sat, unsat or trans fat, lactose, etc...).",

Despite this, at our core, we are social animals, and we like being with other people (whether we like it or not, ah!). A collateral consequence that arises is that people give authenticity and humanity higher value. Federico Marchetti said it beautifully when he predicted that \"in the future there will be one label that will convey [a sense quality] to the customers - 'Made by Humans'\".\nMaking the right choices when it comes to automation isn't always limited to efficiency and cost. Allowing the human touch to permeate your products and services where it matters most, can be a powerful loyalty driver, justifying and even contradicting RPAs or seamlessness.",

When faced with a complication that could turn into a scandal/outrage, these agents announce that fact along with efforts being made to correct the wrong, instead of trying to quietly resolve the matter before it is discovered.",

Besides, although it is hard to measure return on investment for prevention, it is certainly cheaper than the PR crises and loss of trust that happens when it fails.
