This is the first line of defense, and it should go without saying that consumers only rest assured when they trust this is taken care of. Besides, although it is hard to measure return on investment for prevention, it is certainly cheaper than the PR crises and loss of trust that happens when it fails. Every company today should stop and think if they are prioritizing encryption, VPS usage when relevant, collecting only needed data, and the myriad of other good practices that so many neglect in place of cost reduction or marketing stunts.

An equally important side to transparency is how a brand or company behaves in case of data compromise or any abnormal case of attack. For the most part, what is increasingly being adopted is full transparency, in spite of quiet diffusal. Addressing isues that were not planned for, publicly/semi-publicly, builds trust and meets a more understanding consumer base, as opposed to coming accross as deception and losing valuable client and industry loyalty.",pcg,2,1,5,
