This is the first line of defense, and it should go without saying that consumers only rest assured when they trust this is taken care of. Besides, although it is hard to measure return on investment for prevention, it is certainly cheaper than the PR crises and loss of trust that happens when it fails. Every company today should stop and think if they are prioritizing encryption, VPS usage when relevant, collecting only needed data, and the myriad of other good practices that so many neglect in place of cost reduction or marketing stunts.

An equally important side to transparency is how a brand or company behaves in case of data compromise or any abnormal case of attack. For the most part, what is increasingly being adopted is full transparency, in spite of quiet diffusal. Addressing isues that were not planned for, publicly/semi-publicly, builds trust and meets a more understanding consumer base, as opposed to coming accross as deception and losing valuable client and industry loyalty.","Clube de Produtores, Qualidade, I&D",2,1,5,,,"Encrypted Distributed Apps

Despite this, at our core, we are social animals, and we like being with other people (whether we like it or not, ah!).

Federico Marchetti said it beautifully when he predicted that ""in the future there will be one label that will convey [a sense quality] to the customers - 'Made by Humans'"".
Making the right choices when it comes to automation isn't always limited to efficiency and cost. Allowing the human touch to permeate your products and services where it matters most, can be a powerful loyalty driver, justifying and even contradicting RPAs or seamlessness.",,3,1,2,,,"REI Yay Days
