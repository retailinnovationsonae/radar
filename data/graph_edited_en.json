According to the same source, this successful event demonstrated that “renewable energy can be relied upon as a secure and viable source with which to completely meet the country’s electricity demands”. Some of the biggest companies in the world, including Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, are massively buying renewable energy and, consequently, reshaping the entire supply chain. “The IT sector has been responsible for more than 7GW of new renewable energy globally – enough to power 5m homes” says Gary Cook, Greenpeace’s senior corporate campaigner.

To the unaware, the myriad of intolerances we hear about seems to have sprung from nowhere, but it certainly drove an unforeseen demand for the likes of tempeh, kefir, kimchi, flaxseed, and anything else that helps the consumer to steer clear from the wide selection of ingredients they've found harmful (think gluten, sat, unsat or trans fat, lactose, etc...).",

What may be changing, at least in the professional market, is what companies can use to face this threat. Companies should brace for a powerful hit in the form of retirement benefits and healthcare as baby boomers maintain leadership and it simultaneously becomes harder to attract (and maintain) young talent.

It outlined the main challenges to be addressed and the main areas of action to be developed, namely: sourcing food grown regeneratively and locally, where appropriate; making the most of food; and designing and marketing food products that are not only healthy from a nutritional point of view, but also in the way they are produced. Porto is one of the four focus cities where an in-depth analysis was carried out, along with Brussels, Guelph and São Paulo.",

This is the first line of defense, and it should go without saying that consumers only rest assured when they trust this is taken care of. Besides, although it is hard to measure return on investment for prevention, it is certainly cheaper than the PR crises and loss of trust that happens when it fails. Every company today should stop and think if they are prioritizing encryption, collecting only needed data, and the myriad of other good practices that so many neglect in place of cost reduction or marketing stunts.\n\nAn equally important side to transparency is how a brand behaves in case of data compromise or any attack. For the most part, what is increasingly being adopted is full transparency, in opposition of quiet diffusal. Addressing isues that were not planned for, publicly/semi-publicly, builds trust and meets a more understanding consumer base, instead of coming accross as deception and losing valuable client and industry loyalty.",

Despite this, at our core, we are social animals, and we like being with other people (whether we \"like\" it or not).

Federico Marchetti said it beautifully when he predicted that \"in the future there will be one label that will convey [a sense quality] to the customers - 'Made by Humans'\". Making the right choices when it comes to automation isn't always limited to efficiency and cost.
