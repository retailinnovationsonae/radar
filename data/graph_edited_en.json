According to the same source, this successful event demonstrated that �renewable energy can be relied upon as a secure and viable source with which to completely meet the country�s electricity demands�. Some of the biggest companies in the world, including Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, are massively buying renewable energy and, consequently, reshaping the entire supply chain. �The IT sector has been responsible for more than 7GW of new renewable energy globally � enough to power 5m homes� says Gary Cook, Greenpeace�s senior corporate campaigner.

To the unaware, the myriad of intolerances we hear about seems to have sprung from nowhere, but it certainly drove an unforeseen demand for the likes of tempeh, kefir, kimchi, flaxseed, and anything else that helps the consumer to steer clear from the wide selection of ingredients they've found harmful (think gluten, sat, unsat or trans fat, lactose, etc...).",

                "description": "One of the most significant parts contributing to Privacy Protection as a whole, is the preventive avoidance of data leaks, attacks, phishing, fraud, etc... This is the first line of defense, and it should go without saying that consumers only rest assured when they trust this is taken care of. Besides, although it is hard to measure return on investment for prevention, it is certainly cheaper than the PR crises and loss of trust that happens when it fails. Every company today should stop and think if they are prioritizing encryption, VPS usage when relevant, collecting only needed data, and the myriad of other good practices that so many neglect in place of cost reduction or marketing stunts.\n\nAn equally important side to transparency is how a brand or company behaves in case of data compromise or any abnormal case of attack. For the most part, what is increasingly being adopted is full transparency, in spite of quiet diffusal. Addressing isues that were not planned for, publicly/semi-publicly, builds trust and meets a more understanding consumer base, as opposed to coming accross as deception and losing valuable client and industry loyalty.",
