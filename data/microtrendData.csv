The car has long been dominated by AM & FM radio and that is still the case. Why? Radio is EASY. Hit a button and the radio just plays.

Podcasting in the car is NOT easy, especially if you’re tethering your phone via USB or connecting your phone to your car via Bluetooth. For many people, it’s just too much of a hassle.

Thanks to the highest ever annual increase of cars with in-dash, internet-powered entertainment systems, though, Tom says that may finally be starting to change.

“The reason why radio hangs on so much in the car, is it’s just so easy to use. You’ve got five presets and there’s what you’re going to listen to. Even though you have all of this content on your phone, it’s not easy to get to when you’re driving. The integrated in-dash entertainment system stat is going be the rate limiting factor on rapid growth in all things audio. As that spikes, I think everything else gets pulled up with it.”
It’s also fascinating to see podcasting overtake satellite radio in the car this year. Satellite radio has always been easier to use than podcasting and has had wider adoption in cars as as a result. This stat suggests that slowly, but surely, podcasting is getting easier to listen to in the car.

Esta iniciativa decorre da implementação do projeto-piloto Iniciação à Programação no 1.º Ciclo do Ensino Básico que, entre 2015 e 2017, envolveu mais de setenta mil alunos.

As atividades de “Programação e Robótica no Ensino Básico”, dirigidas a alunos do 1.º ao 9.º ano de escolaridade, poderão ser dinamizadas, na Oferta Complementar, nas Atividades de Enriquecimento Curricular ou na Oferta de Escola, ficando esta opção ao critério dos órgãos internos do Agrupamento, nos termos do estabelecido nos respetivos diplomas legais.

Os estabelecimentos de ensino envolvidos nesta iniciativa têm acesso a um sistema de acompanhamento e apoio presencial e online, através da realização de diversos eventos regionais, e de uma comunidade de prática que disponibilizará um conjunto de recursos educativos digitais.

A Sessão de Lançamento do projeto ocorreu no dia 18 de outubro de 2017, no Auditório da Microsoft, em Lisboa. Nesta sessão, foram apresentadas as Linhas Orientadoras e as dinâmicas gerais que irão ser desenvolvidas no âmbito do projeto.

The majority of global consumers maintain their physical health by sticking to the basics: eating healthy, nutritious foods (64%), exercising (62%) and getting enough rest (57%).
Consumer implications:
The media regularly touts the health benefits of this food or that drink, and there are even certain combinations that should or should not be eaten together.
