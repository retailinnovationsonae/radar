Plastic is not biodegradable, which means it will stay around for hundreds of years – representing a big threat for the environment. \nThe debate on reducing plastic production is gathering more followers every day and people expect retailers to be a part of the process to save the world. Sustainable materials for packaging and bulk food are some of the solutions that customers value and are willing to pay extra to get. ",
