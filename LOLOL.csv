We have entered a sometimes-unconfortable weird duality where we want an extremely personalized experience everywhere but also tend to reject any prying attempts to learn patterns of ours.
It is now up to companies and institutions to invest in two complementary and necessary venues: transparency so that the person never feels they're being misled and privacy protection methods and structures.
Not every entity has the magnitude of Facebook to withstand the loss of trust and finantial hit breach after breach.,With the slew of machine learning and AI implementations to monitor behavior and find patterns in everything, the field of personalization has never been more fertile - and people will embrace it.
The crucial factor here is to find the right balance between customer data and driving convenience - customer loyalty will reside in the entity that can meet that one consumer's demands to a T.,Customer experience has a 24/7 frequency, nowadays. Through chat platforms such as Whatsapp or Instagram Direct, people can easily get in touch with anyone, anywhere, and they want instant answers to any query. �If you can take my money 24 hours a day, you should be available to answer my questions, too.� ,While the sharing economy was mostly accelerated in mobility and real estate rental, its consequences are being felt universally. This is one of the big drivers in the rise of platform organizations.
The regular user is - of course - relatively agnostic to how a service operates. The consensual shift to platforms supported by sharing economy models is explained by the sheer scalability and seamlessness that are now within reach.
To businesses operating with their core parallel to these players, it is urgent that they form partnerships, because the advantages in speed, efficiency and ease of maintenance/cost to run seem unrivalled and piling up.,Part of a greater whole, transparency has never been as present in people's minds as today. Besides paying attention to the supply chain footprint of the food we buy, society is increasingly privileging options in every field that operate in a glassdoor manner. Clothes coming from Southeast Asia resonate with humans rights violations. Users are glad to know that Apple is promising to use 100% recycled Aluminum and stride to recycle 100% in their own and (already billions) other iPhones sold.,Technology adoption among is universally attributed to Millenials and younger generations. This is partly true, but leads to a gross underestimation of tech use in older generations. Especially older urban dwellers are more than happy to adopt smart locks for safety, kitchen assistants for convenient cooking and uber to stop waiting for a taxi while it's raining.
This proves to be a greatly misrepresented segment that embodies a great business oportunity, if only companies start planning around it (remember older generations also have greater purchasing power).,There�s an increasing saturation over the massification of artificially fabricated lifestyles projected by TV, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. People are craving for authenticity and real-human connections. ,Having an active interest in one's health. Be health consciousness implies to know what good health is and what are healthy and unhealthy practices; to monitor health condition like body weight, sleep control, sight and hearing test, mental checkups; to avoid practices that adversely affect one�s health; to take corrective actions whenever your health is not within acceptable norms.,,,Technology has finally matured enough for customers to start trusting it to avoid some of the most inefficient parts of their shopping experience. Machine learning is helping people to complete their shopping list while artificial vision is enabling the skipping of those never-ending checkout lines. Many other applications are being implemented to optimize people�s time and maximize their life quality. ,The massification of online courses reflects the increasing effort that is needed nowadays to keep up with technology advancements. Knowledge is more accessible then ever, but also more volatile. Learning is a continuous process and people are looking for the right tools to keep on board of the train to the future. ,Collected from renewable sources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves and geothermal heat, renewable energy is charging the future. �It is expected that by 2040 the production of renewable electricity will be able to guarantee, in a cost-effective way, the total annual electricity consumption of mainland Portugal� advanced the Portuguese Renewable Energy Association as in March 2018, renewable energy generated 104% of Portugal�s electricity consumption. According to the same source, this successful event demonstrated that �renewable energy can be relied upon as a secure and viable source with which to completely meet the country�s electricity demands�. Some of the biggest companies in the world, including Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, are massively buying renewable energy and, consequently, reshaping the entire supply chain. �The IT sector has been responsible for more than 7GW of new renewable energy globally � enough to power 5m homes� says Gary Cook, Greenpeace�s senior corporate campaigner. ,Without touching the discussion topic to what caused this movement, it is unquestionably that there is a fast-rising concern for how "gut-friendly" the food we buy really is. Fashionable expressions such as pro or prebiotics are dealbreakers in the daily choices made by a growingly significant segment of society. To the unaware, the myriad of intolerances we hear about seems to have sprung from nowhere, but it certainly drove an unforeseen demand for the likes of tempeh, kefir, kimchi, flaxseed, and anything else that helps the consumer to steer clear from the wide selection of ingredients they've found harmful (think gluten, sat, unsat or trans fat, lactose, etc...).,Less than a quarter of the food that is wasted in the US, UK and Europe could feed the one billion hungry people all around the world. With an estimation of 1.3 billion tonnes of food being wasted every year, people are looking for this topic with particular concern and expect the companies where they spend their money to tackle this issue.,Total foreign residency in Portugal has been steadily rising for a few years, to a point where a significant demographic segment has different primary languages and cultures. If the current political climate remains relatively stable, this is only expected to accelerate.
With today's advances in personalization, behavior analysis and related tools, great oportunities lie in adjusting supply to a changing customer base.,Today's means of acquiring knowledge in any topic is widely different from a few years ago. Content creation in the web today has reached a granularity that allows for whomever, with whichever skillbase to quickly find informative content from the most practical topics such as "How to: fry, bake, poach and scramble eggs" to the most complex and abstract subjects in Advanced Mathematics or Quantum Mechanics.
While true volume exists mostly in english, with instant contextual translation making strides, it is all quickly being democratized to all.
This trend is being felt at the corporate level too, with Google, Apple and other powerhouses announcing that academic degrees are no longer weighted the way they were.
Companies should much rather employ someone who can quickly and effectively learn skill X when current standard Y turns obsolete than a proven expert in Y.,People will compare players, even from different industries, using the same criteria. Customers are indifferent to cost structure: if a store offers free bags, they'll expect the same treat from every other store. To stay competitive, companies should be able to optimize their cost structure and establish what's essential to provide what the customers are expecting. To do so, they must understand that people's expectations can come from the least expectable places.,It is no secret that the portuguese demographic pyramid is getting dangerously top-heavy. What may be changing, at least in the professional market, is what companies can use to face this threat. Companies should brace for a powerful hit in the form of retirement benefits and healthcare as baby boomers maintain leadership and it simultaneously becomes harder to attract (and maintain) young talent. The uberization of every field is one way this is being tackled (or rather, circumvented), but awareness (and investment along with it) needs to increase for companies to find creative ways of facing this looming threat.,Over the last few years, society has embraced connected devices and progressively divorced traditional linear content services. Over-the-top (OTT) video from players such as Netflix, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku had a delayed start in the Portuguese market, as is usual, but this makes it all the more relevant for side business to rethink their content design and marketing. Advertisers today have a blank canvas full of opportunities to connect with consumers in a previously impossibly organic, personalized manner.,According to ConvenienceStore, �the increase in shoppers looking for meals �for the next three days� is growing with 55% of shoppers claiming to visit a convenience store for a top-up mission, 11% for a meal prep mission and 17% for food-to-go�.
As the shopping experience keeps getting more convenient, people tend to privilege smaller baskets and increase the frequency of their visits to the store. Retailers are accompanying this trend by reducing store�s dimensions, while optimizing their cost per square meter. ,A social trend that has closely followed the technological advances in interfacing, it is shifting the paradigm of how we connect with machines. There is a reason babies today can outperform their parents on a tablet at the age of 2 (imagine doing that with MS-DOS in the 80s) and there will also be consequences.
For one, there will be zero tolerance for unintuitive UI, users will simply move to one of your 100 competitors for a better experience. We need to build for any human to use, with bonus points if the interface is adaptive to the individual user.,,,Reviews, good pictures and nice displays are not enough anymore. The biggest friction in eCommerce is the fact that, before buying a product, people still want to feel its touch, taste or smell. And whoever's capable of providing that will get the upper hand over those who can't.,,According to BBC, 400 million tons of plastic is produced every year with 40% of its applications being thrown out after the first use. Plastic is not biodegradable, which means it will stay around for hundreds of years � representing a big threat for the environment. 
The debate on reducing plastic production is gathering more followers every day and people expect retailers to be a part of the process to save the world. Sustainable materials for packaging and bulk food are some of the solutions that customers value and are willing to pay extra to get. ,Consumers are shifting their attention from TV to Youtube, Facebook and Instagram. Social media influencers are the new epicenter of new lifestyles, behaviors and social trends. This represents an opportunity for retailers to promote their products in a more decentralized (and effective) way. Companies who provide digital sharable products and experiences increase their reach with continuously growing scalability. ,,,,,A single family will probably have numerous diet restrictions: grandma is lactose intolerant, the father is gluten--free and the older daughter is trying a vegan regimen. The criteria of this family�s shopping list is almost impossible to meet � and that�s why they�ll prefer the retailer who provides them a customized service that addresses all their needs. By reducing the amount of plastic needed for packaging, bulk food is a win-win situation to the customer, the retailer, and the planet.,,Consumers want to know the story of the product. A study conducted by Origin/Hill Holiday found that people are willing to pay more for a product that's accompanied by a narrative - its perceived value will increase if it's followed by the producer�s story, another user's review or any other type of content that helps people relating to that particular item or service.,Consumer's attention span has been abruptly decreasing for the past few years. If a brand can't communicate its messages or value propositions in the first seconds of the conversation, people will look for something else. Customers expect to be immediately served and will have no mercy for the runner up in the delivery race. Whoever's serves first, serves better. ,FOMO defines the fear of not getting in on a deal, experience, event or other activity, strongly correlated with social pressure. It is not exactly recent/emergent, but is today increasingly relevant, and is most prevalent among millenials and younger generations, in/entering prime spending age.
Marketing tends to overuse this concept to motivate consumers to do last-minute purchasing decisions. This has to be done with care, as it risks frustrating loyal customers who will then be tired of having their hand forced.,The number of offices with a desk rotation policy is increasing everywhere. Workers are valuing the convenience that flexible work stations represent, as well as the freedom to work from home.,Too much choice can be as harmful as no choice at all: just think of the time you spend trying to choose what to watch on Netflix. AI and Data mining are helping customers making some sense of the chaos with shopping list recommendations or customized campaigns. ,Schizophrenic (or non-linear) consumption portrays the fact that some consumers are willing to spend less money on some purchases so that they can dive into some other indulgences (e.g. exclusively buying white brand food to save for an iPhone). This behavior can be fostered by financial savviness or can simply be arbitrary. ,The number of people with particular diets is increasing and food retailers must adapt. People want a customized service for every situation (e.g. 2 people in a couple buying 2 different meals and still eating together),People, particularly millennials, are increasingly looking for careers with a purpose and avoiding jobs with meaningless repetitive tasks.,The fight against animal cruelty keeps gathering new supporters and some paradigms such as bullfighting and slaughterhouses may have their days counted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
